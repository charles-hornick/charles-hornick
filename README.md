# Hey, I'm Charles 👋

Java Software Engineer with 15+ years of hands-on experience turning complex, aging codebases into maintainable, high-performing applications — without the "let's rewrite everything" approach.

## What I Do

I help companies tackle their Java technical debt through **smart refactoring**: structured audits, targeted improvements, and knowledge transfer so your team stays autonomous after I leave.

**The kind of problems I solve daily:**
- SQL queries running in seconds → brought down to milliseconds
- API timeouts at 60s → under 80ms
- Test coverage at 7% → pushed to 91%
- Monoliths that nobody dares to touch → modular, testable, deployable

## Tech Stack

```
Languages    → Java 8 / 17, SQL
Frameworks   → Spring Boot, JTE, HTMX
Databases    → PostgreSQL
Infra        → Docker, Kubernetes
Quality      → SonarQube, OWASP ZAP, Gatling, JUnit
Architecture → Clean Architecture, Modular Monoliths, Domain-Driven Design
```

## How I Work

🔍 **Audit** — SonarQube, CodeScene, OWASP ZAP, Gatling → full picture of what's wrong and what matters most

🛠️ **Execute** — Iterative refactoring, mob-programming with your team, no big bang rewrites

✅ **Validate** — Your team works independently on the codebase. If they can, mission accomplished.

## Beyond Code

I care about **software craftsmanship**, not just shipping features. I believe the 9th principle of the Agile Manifesto — *continuous attention to technical excellence* — is the most underrated one.

I also believe most microservices migrations are a mistake. Fight me.
